# Speech Emotion Recognition in White Noise

This project investigates the impact of **white noise and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)** on **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)** ‚Äî a key challenge for deploying SER systems in real-world, acoustically adverse environments (e.g., public transport, hearing aids, assistive tech).

> This research is part of my MSc dissertation in Language Sciences: Technology of Language and Speech @ UCL.

## Project Objective

- Analyse how different **SNR levels** affect the performance of emotion classification models  
- Build a noise-aware SER benchmark using the **RAVDESS** dataset  
- Apply **signal processing techniques** to simulate real-world degradation  
- Train and evaluate models (traditional and deep learning) under varying noise conditions  
- Establish practical **thresholds and recommendations** for SER robustness in noisy environments

---

## Core Features

- Noise injection pipeline for white noise with adjustable SNR  
- Extraction of acoustic features (e.g. **MFCCs**, pitch, energy) using **Librosa**  
- Training of **XGBoost classifiers** and deep models (planned)  
- Benchmark generation and performance comparison across SNR levels  
- Visualisation of performance degradation using **Seaborn** & **Matplotlib**
